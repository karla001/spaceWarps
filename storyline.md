It is a dangerous journey full of space warps. Humanity's hope has been split into two ships, to improve the odds of survival.   

Both you and one other captain have been selected to fly the space ships due to your impressive skills. Only one ship will be able to make it to planet Senka, the other will perish. Get to planet Senka! Humanity's hope is in your hands.
