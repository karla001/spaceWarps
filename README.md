#Space Warps
### An adventure through space!


**Description:**

Space Warps is a modern take on chutes and ladders. It uses the same concepts for sending players forward and backward on the board, the chutes and ladders have been replaced by warps(in this game meaning anomalies in space). Like in chutes and ladders the players moves are decided by a dice that generates a random number from 1-4. Space Warps takes the fun of chutes and ladders and places it in a futuristic space voyage setting.

**Next steps:**

1. Incorporating more player icon animation within the game. 
2. PLaying a sound effect when warp is activated.
3. Add to the game's storyline as the players navigate through the board.
4. Create a feature which involves more player interaction(i.e.: accepting the player's name as input).
5. Make stars visible behind the PNGs placed on board.
6. Editing css to make game mobile friendly.
